# On-Statistical-Efficiency-in-Learning
This repo summarizes the open-source codes related to the following work:

 Jie Ding, Enmao Diao, Jiawei Zhou, and Vahid Tarokh, "On Statistical Efficiency in Learning"
 
Experimental settings and results from the codes are summarized in the pdf file 'experiments.pdf', a supplementary material of the above reference.

## Requirements
The codes are based on the Python language. Please see the requirements.txt for the prerequisite packages.

## Instruction
 - Run introductory Logistic Regression and Neural Networks results with intrologistic.py and introneuralnet.py
 - Run the main Logistic Regression and Neural Networks results with logistic.py and neuralnet.py
 - Run numerical comparisons on iid data with data.py
 - Reproduce figures with reprint_logistic.py and reprint_neuralnet.py
